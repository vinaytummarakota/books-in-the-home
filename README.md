# "Books in the Home" Meta-Analysis

This living meta-analysis estimates the causal impact of distributing books to children on their reading achievement and oral reading fluency. It is featured in my Substack article, "Do books in the home really improve academic achievement?".

## Inclusion Criteria

To be included in the meta-analysis, a study needed to satisfy the following inclusion criteria:

-   Randomly assign students/schools to control vs treatment
-   Control could not have received a similar intervention by other means (e.g. Cohort 2 of McGill-Franzen, Allington, and Ward (2020))
-   Provide sufficient information to estimate/approximate covariate-adjusted effect sizes in terms of Hedge's $g$

These inclusion criteria identified 10 studies.

## Effect Size Calculations

All effect size calculations are described from start-to-finish in `coded_effect_sizes_documentation.pdf`.
